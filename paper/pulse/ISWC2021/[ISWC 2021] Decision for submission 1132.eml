  Feedback from Program Committee Meeting

    After a long discussion in the PC meeting, this paper was found to have an
    interesting approach and an insightful analysis. Do however, read all reviews
    carefully, in particular the comments from reviewer 4 with regard to the "related
    publications about the background of photoplethysmography generators".

  Confidence

    Very confident - I am knowledgeable in the area

  Contribution to ISWC

    This paper contributes with a system that measures the user's heart rate and
    "forwards" this signal to a commercial smartwatch's PPG sensor using a display
    underneath the watch. An analysis for several commercial smartwatches and using a
    series of displays was performed. This system has a niche application, the more
    interesting one being: Enabling users with prosthetic arms to use fitness or
    exercise applications that rely on PPG sensing on a smartwatch.

  Overall Rating

    Maybe accept: I would agree with accepting this paper.

  The Review

    The paper presents an interesting approach how to fool a PPG sensor. The described
    method provides a low cost method for inducing artificial heartbeats into a wide
    range of smartwatches.

    Not only is this method feasible, as described in the paper, for the transfer of a
    PPG signal to an artificial body or for faking an exercise routine but it may also
    be used for rapid prototyping and to test novel apps and algorithms under real
    world conditions. The authors should here also more clearly  argue for and stress
    the fact that commercial watches have a wide range of measurement patterns (as
    highlighted by Wolling, Unity in Diversity, IEEE PC 2019).  The proposed method
    reliably induces a given static heartbeat on a wide range of devices. This seems
    to indicate that the method is applicable under real world conditions. It would be
    of interest if this method performs equally well when the heartbeat is changing
    and how fast the smartwatches can follow a given heartbeat curve.

    Also of interest would be a demonstration of a successful heartbeat transfer. This
    would demonstrate that the real world application described in this paper is
    feasible with the methodology presented.

    Another test which could be performed and which would shine light on the
    performance of this approach would be to test the limitations of this approach,
    how low and how high can the heartbeat be before a detection is not possible
    anymore. Especially for the Apple watch that was tested another approach would be
    to test if this method has the capability to trip the irregular heartbeat alert.
    This would broaden the possible applications of the proposed method.

    The only thing in question is the novelty of the proposed method. Faking the
    heartbeat using a display has been described elsewhere (see for example https
    ://mo-life.blogspot.com/2018/10/how-to-trick-heart-rate-monitor-on-your.html). For
    a broader impact it would be interesting to see if this approach can also be used
    to induce different HRV metrics to test a wider range of algorithms on a simulated
    heartbeat.

  Contribution to ISWC

    Current methods of pulse detection use PPG sensors which require blood flow for
    data acquisition as they rely on reflected light. The authors identify this as an
    equity issue as this means that pulse detection is not possible in those with
    prosthetics.  This is a novel and worthwhile endeavour and I thank the authors for
    seeing this gap and seeking to address it. They propose a system to allow such
    users to have heart rate data recorded using 2 additional wearables which work in
    conjunction with existing wearable smartwatches.

  The Review

    Current methods of pulse detection use PPG sensors which require blood flow for

    equity issue as this means that pulse detection is not possible in those with
    prosthetics.  This is a novel and worthwhile endeavour and I thank the authors for
    seeing this gap and seeking to address it. The paper proposes a new method,
    disp2ppg, which they find has an error rate within 3bpm of the current PPG sensors
    used. This system involves a sensor worn on the living arm which speaks to a small
    display. The display changes its brightness based on the heart rate data from the
    sensor. The traditional smart watch is worn over this sensor - this means that the
    heart rate data is using this display to bounce back the light and calculate the
    heart rate. As the display changes based on the sensor heart rate this is able to
    give a similar reading to their true heart rate. This paper describes the
    evaluation of this system with several commercial smartwatches.

    This system is novel and worthwhile to help individuals, and the analysis is
    clearly written. What could be strengthened in the paper is the ‘so what’. There
    is room for a clearer scoping of further work. Consideration of the end users is
    also needed - is the aim that individuals will always have to wear a sensor and a
    display under the watch or is there a proposal for a standard so that the sensor
    can talk directly to the smart watches? How long can the sensors be worn for? Is
    this only something that would be used during exercise or is the aim to create
    sensors that would be wearable for long periods of time for continuous heart rate
    monitoring that is affording to the population with in tact arms?

  Contribution to ISWC

    This paper contributes a novel method for synthesizing pulse metrics to "trick" a
    smartwatch into recognizing a heart rate.  PPG is a method of reading the "pulse"
    by emitting a light signal and reading back the reflection.  As more blood
    "pulses" through the vessel, more light is reflected.  This invention simulates
    that variable "reflection" by using a display to emit a varying amount of light
    into the sensor.  The signal could be synthetic or reflect the users actual pulse.

  Overall Rating

    Probably accept: I would argue for accepting this paper.

  The Review

    Overall, although this invention is likely limited it is a clever idea and there
    is nothing else like it in the literature. The application - a workaround to make
    amputees feel more "normal" is also very inventive and not something that I would
    have otherwise considered.

    A few details need to be corrected - the caption to Figure 2 " The time series
    brightness of the display that makes the smartwatch detect a single pulse" needs
    to be changed. Most smart watches, to the best of my knowledge,  do not "detect a
    single pulse - although you are generating a waveform that reflects the profile of
    a single pulse most smartwatches actually average over multiple beats taking a
    dominant mode over a minute.
    You can say you are generating a single pulse profile, not that the smartwatch is
    detecting it.

    The biggest challenge will be the interface between the true pulse detector and
    the smartwatch, since these are constantly evolving communication standard

    An additional extension would be to detect and match the color of light being
    emitted from the smart watch.  This would better match what the PPG is expecting
    as a reflection.  another additional extension would be varying the color to
    better reflect what the watches are potentially emitting.

    It was also unclear if there was a formative study or set of interviews with
    amputees that uncovered this as an unmet need, it is in interesting discovery and
    I am wondering if the authors thought up the idea themselves or if the idea was
    suggested to them from someone suffering limb loss. Overall this could be a boon
    to those seeking normalcy after limb loss.  It is also an interesting
    consideration to have a robot wear a smartwatch that was displaying a fake heart
    rate - would this make a robot seem more human?  Could a smartwatch be used to
    make an robot seem like it was experiencing an emotion or a set of exertions?

    The paper presents a method of measuring PPG signals on biological body parts and
    sending the information to a display on a prosthetic arm. The display is then used
    to input the heart rate to the smartwatch. The setup was evaluated thoroughly with
    different smartwatches of different manufacturers running on different operating

    The submission contributes to increase the merit of wearables located at
    prosthetics and therefore helps in the measurement of vital parameters for

  Overall Rating

  The Review

    Dear authors, 
    thank you for your contribution. While I appreciate the ethics of your aims and
    highly value the importance of the overall topic, I do not think the method you
    described in this paper is the right way to overcome the problems faced in this
    field.

    The paper presents a method of measuring PPG signals on biological body parts and
    sending the information to a display on a prosthetic arm. The display is then used
    to input the heart rate to the smartwatch. The setup was evaluated thoroughly with
    different smartwatches of different manufacturers running on different operating
    systems including different detection algorithms.

    Within to the concept and implementation of the presented approach, several
    questions arise:

    • Why is the heart rate that is measured at the junction between arm and
    prosthetics not sent to the smartwatch directly (e.g., wirelessly)?

    • Why do the authors prefer an approach that requires extra hardware, such as a
    PPG sensor at the junction and a display for inputting the data into the
    smartwatch, when smartwatches already can measure the heartrate by applying
    acceleration sensors? These sensors are already built into every smartwatch and
    the detection approach would require no extra hardware.

    • The authors do not discuss the effect of ghost heart rates that are provided by
    all devices that apply algorithms for extracting heart rate signals from PPG
    sensors. These artifacts can be seen by applying smartwatches to objects, such as
    reflective table surfaces or bananas (e.g., https://screenrant.com/apple-watch-
    bananas-heart-rate-fail/). How do these effects (reflections etc.) influence the
    proposed approach?

    • Does the general detection error of PPG sensors (e.g., due to motion artifacts)
    increase due to the application of two different PPG sensors (one at the junction
    between arm and prosthetics and one inside of the smartwatch) and/or due to the
    quality of the applied display type?

    Let me specify and justify my view while moving through the different sections of
    your paper.


    INTRODUCTION

    „With the proposed method, even when a smartwatch is attached to an artificial
    body, the smartwatch can read the person’s pulse data by changing the light of the
    display under the PPG  sensor of the smartwatch according to the pulse data
    measured  at the junction of the living body and the prosthetic hand.”

    The application scenario is not convincing, since there are other technologies
    that already support the recognition of heart rate at prosthetics without the need
    for modifications of the smartwatch itself (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes that
    send their data to the smartwatch).

    “When applied to a remote robot avatar, the operator’s biometric data can be
    measured on the avatar’s body.“

    Personally, I do not see the need for the robot avatar scenario since the heart
    rate of the operator could be transmitted directly to a display without the detour
    of being measured on a display and then read by a PPG sensor.


    RELATED WORK

    “These methods using inertia sensors such as accelerometers are applicable even
    with [an] artificial body[;] however, methods using pulse data are unavailable. “

    There are several publications that apply the inertial sensors of smartwatches
    worn at the wrist to deduce pulse data:

    Hernandez, J., McDuff, D., & Picard, R. W. (2015, May). Biowatch: estimation of
    heart and breathing rates from wrist motions. In 2015 9th International Conference
    on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth) (pp.
    169-176). IEEE.

    Haescher, M., Matthies, D. J., Trimpop, J., & Urban, B. (2016, May).
    SeismoTracker: Upgrade any smart wearable to enable a sensing of heart rate,
    respiration rate, and microvibrations. In Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference
    Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 2209-2216).

    Haescher, M., Matthies, D. J., Trimpop, J., & Urban, B. (2015, June). A study on
    measuring heart-and respiration-rate via wrist-worn accelerometer-based
    seismocardiography (SCG) in comparison to commonly applied technologies. In
    Proceedings of the 2nd international Workshop on Sensor-based Activity Recognition
    and Interaction (pp. 1-6).


    EVALUATION

    “The target heart rate was tested from 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) in
    increments of 5, which is the ra[n]ge of the average heart rate for adults [5]”

    I assume that you are referring to a resting heart rate range, since the range of
    60-100bpm neither includes a rising heart rate during exercise nor the lower heart
    rate during night sleep. Outside of resting states, a range of 40bpm to 180bpm
    seems necessary (for healthy adults, as even this range would still not include
    pathologies of the heart that can cause the heart rate to drop below or go beyond
    these thresholds).


    CONCLUSION

    In general, I appreciate your motivation to provide the same smartwatch experience
    to individuals with disabilities (e.g., with amputations). Nevertheless, I do not
    think that your proposed solution is the best approach. Especially in light of
    existing solutions which have been described in publications that are missing in
    your related work.

    Due to these aspects, I am not convinced that the paper presents a valuable
    contribution and would therefore recommend rejecting the paper.

  Contribution to ISWC

    This paper proposed an idea to measure the heart rate using commercially available
    smartwatches on a prosthetic hand. The authors plan to use a pulse sensor that is
    placed on the live body, and then transmit the heart rate value detected by the
    pulse sensor to a small display screen placed beneath a commercially available
    smartwatch. The screen color will change according to the heart rate value to
    simulate a PPG signal. The final heart rate will be calculated again by the
    commercial smartwatch using simulator PPG emitted to its PPG sensor.

  Overall Rating

    Probably reject: I would argue for rejecting this paper.

  The Review

    Major reason:

    1.      If the pulse sensor that was placed on the live body can measure an
    accurate heart rate, there is no reason to introduce another possible error by
    converting the heart rate to a screen color info and let the smartwatch measure
    heart rate from that again. The entire design of the study is not plausible. The
    smartwatch PPG sensor is not designed to detect the color change of an LCD screen
    under a strong ambient light environment, so it will be really questionable if the
    author could detect heart rate from a display screen on the prosthetic hand in
    real life. The back of the Apple Watch is curved, so there are lots of space
    between the watch back and the screen. This type of loosely wearing will lead to
    the amplitude of the PPG signal too small to be noticed by the smartwatch
    algorithm, thus, the heart rate calculated by the smartwatch will not be accurate.
    The large gap will also cause a deteriorated PPG waveform if the user moves the
    prosthetic hand, and eventually, it is impossible to get any correct heart rate in
    real life using this method.

    2.      The author did not list any related publications about the background of
    photoplethysmography generators. At least I found this paper related to this
    topic, “Modeling photoplethysmographic signals in camera-based perfusion
    measurements: optoelectronic skin phantom.” Moreover, I have never seen a paper
    that did not put any reference in the introduction part of the paper. There is
    plenty of space on the 5th page, so the page limit is not a reason for not putting
    enough reference paper.

    Minor comments:

    1.      The author did not list the refreshing frequency of the display screen
    which generates fake PPG. The author also did not put any information about the
    smartwatch PPG sampling frequency. The drawing frequency seems to be 30 Hz.

    2.      In section 4.2.3, the author mentioned an unspecified smartwatch “SMART R
    F-18” and an unknown watch operating system “Original OS”. No reference was added
