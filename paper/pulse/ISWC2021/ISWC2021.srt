00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,440
My name is Atsuhiro Fujii from Ritsumeikan University in Japan.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,860
Now, I will explain about our pulse wave generation method, disp2ppg.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,000
This method inputs generated pulse data to the PPG sensor using display.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,340
First, I will explain the background of my research.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:32,000
With the growing awareness of health management, wearable devices that record biometric information have become widely used.

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,690
The most common technique of recording pulse data is called PPG.

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:49,000
It measures pulse data by irradiating LED light onto the skin and detecting changes in the light reflected through blood vessels.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,500
Due to this mechanism, blood flow is necessary for the PPG sensor to measure the value.

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,000
A problem arises when wearable devices are used on artificial bodies.

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:18,000
The call, message, clock, payment functions, and the acceleration, gyroscope, and GPS sensors equipped with wearable devices are available on artificial bodies.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
However, the PPG sensor is unavailable on artificial bodies.

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:31,500
We can think of several methods to solve this problem, but another problem may arise.

14
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:41,000
The best solution we can think of is to let the sensor equipped with the device read arbitrary values.

15
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:52,300
This method requires user to wear an additional device, but does not require any modification to the smartwatch or application.

16
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:05,800
Our method inputs values to the PPG sensor without using blood flow, so users of the artificial body can also use commercially wearable devices and applications.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In addition, enabling the input of arbitrary pulse data also leads to the demonstration of the vulnerability of PPG sensors.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Pulse data is one of the most important biological information, as it is used to estimate respiratory rate, detect arrhythmia, estimate emotion, and so on.

19
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
I will introduce proposed method.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,500
The bloodstream absorbs and reflects the LED light.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
To enable this property using displays, Colors that absorb and reflect LED light should be prepared.

22
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,000
Colors are grayscale data.

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:03:03,000
The more white the display is drawn, the brighter the reflected light will be, and the more black the display is drawn, the darker the reflected light will be.

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:14,800
The optimal Colors vary depending on the display-smartwatch combinations, so we conducted heuristically search and decide the optimal Colors.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,500
I will explain the flow of proposed method.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
First, the user wears an additional PPG sensor to acquire data and detect peaks.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The system calculates the heart rate by counting the number of peaks.

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Next, prepare a number of Colors equal to the calculated heart rate, and draw them on the display in one minute.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,500
Finally, the user can get the same heart rate on the smartwatch as the one obtained from the additional sensor.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The evaluation experiment was conducted using four displays and five smartwatches.

31
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,000
We used several smartwatches with different operating systems.

32
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Therefore, the data acquisition flow differed depending on the smartwatch.

33
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,800
This is how the data was acquired using display D.

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Enter the target heart rate to the console, and the smartwatch will acquire the heart rate.

35
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,500
SMART R was the only smartwatch that was able to correctly input the heart rate using display D.

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Therefore, the evaluation of display D was conducted using only SMART R.

37
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
These are errors between the target heart rate and the measured heart rate.

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,500
Positive values indicate that the heart rate was higher than the target heart rate, and negative values indicate that the heart rate was lower.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The gray points indicate results where the values could not be obtained correctly.

40
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,800
The orange points indicate results with an error of 2.5 bpm or more.

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,800
In many results, the accuracy was very good, with errors of less than 3 bpm.

42
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Here is conclusion.

43
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,800
We proposed disp2ppg, which inputs pulse wave to PPG sensor using display.

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,500
The evaluation experiment was conducted using four displays and five smartwatches.

45
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,500
As a result, the input error was within 3 bpm in most cases.

46
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,500
In the future, we will investigate a mechanism to automatically determine the optimal Colors.

47
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,000
The device will be miniaturized for attachment to a body part.

48
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,300
Now all finished.

49
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you for your attention.
