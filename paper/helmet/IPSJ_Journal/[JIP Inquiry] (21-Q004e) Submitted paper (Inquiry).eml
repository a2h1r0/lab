[Review Result]

(A) Overall Recommendation from Meta-Reviewer
Accept if requirements are met

(B) Comments from Meta-Reviewer
The idea of using head shape for user identification and authentication is =
interesting and seems to be practical in actual scenes. However, there are =
several things to be modified to clarify the usefulness of the method.

1.
It is difficult to understand the contribution of the paper from the abstra=
ct because of the lack of the description of the proposed method. Please ad=
d the description about how to identify and authenticate the user briefly. =
[R2-1]

2.
Please describe the evaluation environment clearly and discuss the robustne=
ss to the individual and the environmental differences. It is expected that=
 size/shape/hairstyle of the subject affects the accuracy of identification=
 and authentication. The size/shape/weight of the helmet may also affect th=
e performance. [R1-1][R2-4]

3.
Please add the discussion about the effect of the sensor position to the pe=
rformance. Also, the performance difference between full helmet and half he=
lmet should be described. (Generally, half helmet is more suitable for many=
 scenes.) [R1-2][R2-3]

4.
Please discuss the limitation of the proposed method. Is the method applica=
ble to all gender and ages? Also, please make the target and the restrictio=
n of the proposed method clear. [R1-3][R2-2][R2-5]

5.
Please discuss how to determine the threshold of user authentication. The F=
RR/FAR crossing points are slightly different between subjects in Fig.9. In=
 actual scene, it seems to be difficult to set the threshold automatically =
to the optimal value.

=AD=E8=80=85-=E8=8B=B1=E8=AA=9E: This paper proposed a method for identifyi=
ng registered users by using multiple (=3D0~32) pressure sensors embedded i=
n a helmet. In the paper, the authors develop two prototype helmets and eva=
luated the performance with 9 subjects. The accuracy of their method is 100=
%. In addition to the basic performance evaluation, they evaluated the perf=
ormance difference with a different number of pressure sensors.


The following points are not clear in this paper:
* Are there any effects by participants =E2=80=9Csize of their head,=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=9Cwight of the helmet itself,=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cchange of hai=
rstyles=E2=80=9D? This information seems directly affect the accuracy of us=
er identification if the method includes a pressure sensor. The author shou=
ld describe the evaluation environment more clearly.

* The identification model is sharable with other helmets? This proposed me=
thod needs to make a model for identifying users from multiple pressure sen=
sors. However, I think the position of the pressure sensor might need to se=
t position strictly. If the sensor position of helmet A and helmet B is dif=
ferent, or the shape of a helmet (balance, weight, and form) is different t=
he accuracy might be changed.

* What is the limitation of this approach? As I pointed before, this evalua=
tion is conducted with only male users. The author cannot assert this appro=
ach is applicable to all gender and ages. The author has to discuss the lim=
itations of this method and add appropriate sentences based on the evaluati=
on as a conclusion.

It seems inappropriate that only the accuracy result was described in abstr=
action description. It should be include that which statistical analysis me=
thod was used and how large the participants. Therefore when a reader searc=
hes for a paper, it is difficult to determine if this is appropriate.


2)
Since the target and restrictions of the proposed method are unclear,  the =
requirements which the method should be, the environment and scale of the u=
se case where it is expected to be applied, and its position with respect t=
o the previous method are also unclear. It is necessary to show the expecte=
d usage target and the requirements, then discuss the advantages of the pro=
posed method against the previous research. The reviewer consider that the =
expressions that detract the previous method to show that the previous rese=
arch does not fit to the authors aim is inappropriate for papers that shoul=
d be objective statements. This also prevents readers from understanding th=
e contributions and claims of this paper.
The reviewer think the following description should be re-consider.

In sec 1.Introduction 2nd paragraph:
The authors slightly mentioned their supposed target as like =E2=80=9Cfacto=
ries and disaster site=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cfor short-term workers=E2=80=
=9D.
  However, in the =E2=80=9CRelated Work=E2=80=9D section, the authors criti=
cized the previous studies for the subjective reasons (not practical, not s=
uitable). Since the previous research did not aim at the same purpose as th=
is paper, it is inappropriate to deny and discuss it.
Denying the previous research does not clarify the required specifications =
of this proposal.
From the above, it is considered that the position of this treatise is uncl=
ear.


In sec 1.Introduction, 4th paragraph :=20
By attaching a Global Positioning System (GPS) module or antenna to localiz=
e the user[2], the name and location of a worker can be determined in real =
time, allowing the foreperson to have a better understanding of the overall=
 situation in the field.=20
  From this description, it is considered that it is supposed to be used ou=
tdoors because the combined use with GPS is set as one of the usage scenes.

In sec 2.1 2nd paragraph, the authors mentioned below;
=E2=80=9CHowever, taking a picture of one=E2=80=99s own face with the camer=
a is complication. Using the palm print and palm vein method, users would h=
ave to hold the camera each time before putting on the helmet. It is also c=
omplication. A camera can be attached to the mouth of the helmet so that th=
e shape and movement of the wearer=E2=80=99s lips and teeth can be acquired=
. However, the space around the mouth inside a full-face helmet is limited,=
 and it is difficult to distinguish the shape and movement around the mouth=
 with a single camera. In addition, this approach is not practical because =
helmets are sometimes used in dark places.=E2=80=9D
  In this paper, the results shows there is little difference between full-=
face helmet and half-helmet sensor combination (shown in Table1/2).  In add=
ition, there is a description that the accuracy is sufficiently obtained by=
 the sensor combination like a half helmet. For this reason, it is inconsis=
tent to describe that it is difficult to use with a full-face helmet. Also,=
 it is considered common to use lights at the same time when shooting with =
a camera in a dark place. It is unfair and lacking respect to discourage pr=
evious research for reasons not to use it in such a general way.=20
It is believed that these statements obscure the position of this treatise.

In sec 2.1, 4th paragraph, the authors mentioned below:
=E2=80=9CHowever, the Limitation of fingerprint authentication is that fing=
erprints can be easily duplicated from photographs. In contrast, head shape=
, which is used in this paper, is a physical characteristic that is difficu=
lt to replicate due to its three-dimensional shape.=E2=80=9D
  Fingerprint authentication technology has already seems to be wide-spread=
ed for unlocking laptop PCs and smart phones. Duplicating the fingerprints =
of other users seems easy in theory, but practical hurdles seems not to be =
low in practical.=20
For this reason, denying previous studies with these reasons cause the clai=
m of this study unclear.

In sec 2.1, 5th paragraph, the authors mentioned below;
=E2=80=9CHowever, there are various ways of putting on a helmet, such as pu=
tting it on in a hurry and taking care not to let the interior of the helme=
t become wet in the rain. Therefore, it is not practical to collect data fr=
om all individuals for various situations.=E2=80=9D
The assumed "various situation" is unclear. It is not an objective descript=
ion because the interpretation differs depending on the reader.

In sec 2.2 the authors cited several references about [16]~[19].
These seems to be benchmark method against the proposed method.
These treatises are previous studies on User Authentication using pressure =
sensors. The reviewer think that the authors should consider in comparison =
with these studies at discussion section.
  Comparing the recognition by Grasping and the recognition of the shape of=
 the head, the latter is considered to be a problem setting that is easier =
to solve because the influence of the time term is small, and it is easily =
assumed that higher accuracy will be obtained.=20
  Details will be placed in the comments about Sec 4.1.


About sec 2.3 =E2=80=9CHead State Recognition=E2=80=9D, the 1st paragraph
References 20 to 22 seem to propose facial expression recognition methods.=
=20
It's abrupt and mysterious because the authors' paper seems not describe th=
at the scope is to use a full-face helmet or to perform personal authentica=
tion from facial expressions. For example, if there are any research that a=
uthenticates a person by identifying patterns of facial expression fluctuat=
ions, the reason for mentioning it may be objectively understandable. At pr=
esent, it seems difficult to understand the significance of this paragraph.

Please unify the treatment of terms and previous research;
  As for sec.2 as a whole, it seems that identification, authentication, an=
d recognition are not very distinct.=20
  There is a mention of the method using EEG, but the 5th paragraph of 2.1 =
states that the method of getting wet should be avoided, and it is thought =
that EEG is also a method that is not resistant to getting wet, but here is=
 no-mentioned. =20


3)
Sec. 3.2 Hardware:
Please specify the reason why a full-face helmet was used. Full-face helmet=
s are used in motorcycles and F1 races, but it seems that half-helmets are =
not common in factories and disaster sites. After reading sec. 4.2.1, reade=
rs could understand that it is for comparison with a half helmet, but it is=
 difficult to judge whether it is a requirement because it is not explained=
 at the time of this section.
Where are the pressure sensors # 20 to # 23 mounted in the image of the hea=
d on the middle/right side on Fig. 6? In this experiment, it seems that the=
 contribution to improving the accuracy of the sensors both # 20 to 23 and =
#26 to #31 were small.=20
Please clarify how well these sensors respond, then why the contribution of=
 these features were small for distinguish the wearer,  and add some consid=
eration to the discussion.
What is the size and circumference of the helmet? Please describe in the te=
xt.
Regarding Fig. 3, the shaded part is hard to see and the caption is abstrac=
t, but is it a prototype using a full-face helmet?
About Fig. 5, what is the thickness of polyurethane sponge? Please specify =
in the figure.

Sec 4.1 Data Collection;
What are the variations of gender, hairstyle, and head size for the subject=
s?
(For example, there are 21 subjects in Reference [16], and the physical spe=
cifications of the subjects are specified.) Are the all sensors responsive =
no matter which subject uses it?=20
Are the all sensors responsive no matter which subject uses it? From Tables=
 1 and 2, it seems that the combinations of sensors with high identificatio=
n accuracy have something in common.=20
Have the authors considered that some sensors may not be responding due to =
poor fitting (some subjects' head size might not match the head size)?
As a proof that one size helmet is enough, please show the reaction status =
of 32 sensors when wearing it. The reviewer thinks there seems to be a poss=
ibility that pressure is mainly applied only to specific 4 to 5 sensors (# =
0, # 3, # 5, # 10, etc.); the other sensors have little fluctuation, and th=
e data might not be actually 32 dimensions.

5)
The reviewer thinks the limitation discussion should be described on this a=
rticle.
Because the authors describe the proposed is a prototype. In the last parag=
raph of Sec4, there is a description "It is necessary to validate with data=
 from a larger number of subjects, as there was a difference in the EER bet=
ween subjects." Which seems the limitation description of the proposed anal=
ysis. However, current description of limitation seems to be poor because t=
here are some papers.

summary:
In this article, an analysis of head and face morphology of 1169 U.S. worke=
rs appears to support 90% variation with 50 components by PCA.

In the proposed method, authentication seems to be accurate with at most 5 =
sensors.=20
Is it possible to consider this proposal to be useful when increasing the n=
umber of subjects to the order of 1000 as shown in the above paper? By usin=
g the 32 sensors helmet described in this proposal, how large the individua=
l could be identified with theoretical estimation, please include it in the=
 discussion.
  For example, vein authentication and fingerprint authentication are suppo=
sed to be used by 1 to 10 million people as mentioned in the following pape=
r [2] in order to cover the number of users of the national and local gover=
nments. How many people are expected to be applied to factories and disaste=
r sites, and please discuss the applicability of the future of this researc=
h to those target.
  How accurate is the proposed method compared to the accuracy of the other=
 Authentication methods cited in the previous studies section (EER0.076 is =
how high it is compared to the accuracy of these related methods? ). Please=
 put the description.

minor point of review:
Sec.4.3.1 2nd paragraph:
=E2=80=9CThe smaller the threshold value in 4 is set,=E2=80=9D
Is this a kind of typo?
