Dear Dr. Murao/=E6=9D=91=E5=B0=BE:

It is a pleasure to accept your manuscript entitled "User Identification Me=
thod based on Head Shape using Pressure Sensors embedded in a Helmet" in it=
s current form for publication in the Journal of Information Processing.  T=
he comments of the reviewer(s) who reviewed your manuscript are included at=
 the foot of this letter.
In the event you received comments from the reviewer(s), please make any ne=
cessary changes for your final draft as soon as possible.

Submission ID: 21-Q004e.R1
Title: User Identification Method based on Head Shape using Pressure Sensor=
s embedded in a Helmet

[Review Result]

(A) Overall Recommendation from Meta-Reviewer
Accept

(B) Comments from Meta-Reviewer
The paper is well revised based on reviewers=E2=80=99 comments.
Though there are still several problems in terms of readability and express=
ion, the reviewers could confirm the effort to clarify the usefulness of th=
e method. So, we recommend the paper should be accepted for publication.

For the camera-ready version of manuscript, I strongly recommend that you m=
odify the paper to improve the readability. The following two items are par=
ticularly important for better readability.

1.
Both of two reviewers pointed out that revised version of abstract is too l=
ong. It is desirable that the abstract can be written within 200 words by s=
ummarizing the current content.

2.
There are several erroneous descriptions throughout the paper. Reviewer 2 p=
ointed out symbol mistakes (in section 3.3.1 and 4.2.2) and some grammatica=
l errors. Also, reviewer 1 pointed out inconsistency of expression. I think=
 that these kinds of problems degrade the readability of the paper. I would=
 strongly recommend you check again throughout the paper.

There are some additional comments for improving the paper in reviewer 2=E2=
=80=99s comment (in (3)). I think that some of the comments may lead the pr=
oposed method to next step. It would be better deal with them as far as you=
 can.

(C) Overall Recommendation from Reviewers

[Comments]
- The summaries seem a bit long. I think it would be readable if the amount=
 of text can be reduced to about 2/3.
- There is some inconsistency in the units of time. I think it would be mor=
e readable to use "seconds" instead of "s".

=AD=E8=80=85-=E8=8B=B1=E8=AA=9E: 1) It seems that the points pointed out in=
 the first peer review have been improved properly.

2) The reviewer searched the following references again and found the follo=
wing related studies.
I) an study to judge wearing with pressure sensor in a helmet=20
II) the authors' previous treatise.
Since these have similar purpose and solution, it is considered that the re=
lationship with these studies should be clarified in this paper.

r 2020 Pages 210=E2=80=93214 https://doi.org/10.1145/3428690.3429158
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3428690.3429158

The authors seem to have submitted a paper related to the international con=
ference, so please specify the difference from that in this paper.
(Although the number of subjects and the experimental results and tables lo=
ok almost the same)


3) Please be prepared for the camera-ready manuscript by responding to new =
questions raised by the additions and corrections.

In Sec. 3.2 Hardware :
This is a comment from the viewpoint of experimental reproducibility.
Thank you for the addition of the helmet size. However, it is not possible =
to specify the inner dimensions because the type and characteristics of the=
 protective material inside the helmet are unknown from the notation of the=
 outer dimensions. It is thought that a description that shows the internal=
 dimensions is necessary (S / M / L , asian fit etc. also seems to be accep=
table). If the helmet used has a product number, it is considered that the =
reader can reproduce the experimental conditions by mentioning it. What siz=
e is the original fit for the each subjects this time? How large the head c=
ircumference of each of the nine subjects and what was the adaptation size?=
 The fact that some sensors do not react by sticking a urethane sponge with=
 a thickness of 2 cm inside means that some subjects are suspected of using=
 a helmet size that is significantly larger than their head size.

Describe the quantization bit resolution from the pressure sensor into Ardu=
ino Mega ADC. The reviewer checked it, it seems that the Arduino Mega is eq=
uipped with 16 channels of 10-bit ADC. s the lower limit of 10-bit quantize=
d at 0V and the upper limit at 5V? Please clarify the explanation.
Is there a belt attached to the chin of the helmet? Half helmets has a belt=
 stopper under the chin to prevent the helmet from coming off the head. Ple=
ase add an explanation about whether the belt was attached and how much tig=
hten it when wearing it.
It affects the top sensor value how the belt was fastened.

In sec 3.3.1 Preprocessing :
Why does the authors decide to use 11/30 (nearly equal 367) ms for calibrat=
ion. Why does the calibration end condition that the difference from the pr=
evious sample frame is within 2V? Please explain why 155V or less is accept=
able. Please clarify the reason.

The sentence =E2=80=9CTime t =3DT_s Time t =3D Ts is the time at which the =
change of =E2=80=A6 2[V] (i =3D Ts, =C2=B7 =C2=B7 =C2=B7 , Ts =E2=88=92 10)=
.=E2=80=9D   seems to be too complicated. Please divide the long sentence i=
n small portions.
The equation "x(t) =3D [x1(t), . . . , p32(t)]" seems wrong. It seems that =
"x(t) =3D [x1(t), . . . , x32(t)]" is correct.
Same mistake was available at authors=E2=80=99 previous conference proceedi=
ngs.

In sec 4.2.2 :
=E2=80=9C#24 and #25 are shown as effective sensors in Table 1.=E2=80=9D
Some consideration has been given from # 20 to # 25, which seems to have co=
ntributed to deepening the results of the treatise.
On the other hand, from Table 1, # 3 also seems to be an effective sensor, =
but why isn't it mentioned?
# 3 is also listed in Table 2 and seems to be the most common.

About Fig.11.
The reason why the # 8, # 9, # 18, and # 19 sensors did not respond well to=
 the two subjects A and B in Fig. 11 was probably because the protective ma=
terial on the top of the helmet was removed.
From this experiment, please add a consideration as to whether the protecti=
ve material should be removed or whether it is better to stack urethane spo=
nges with sensors without removing the protective material to improve the s=
ensor sensitivity.

=E2=80=9CFrom Fig. 11, we can see that the sensor values of #26-#31 of subj=
ect A hardly changed.=E2=80=9D
Isn't it the Subject B's result that hasn't changed much?
The Subject A's result seems to be that there are some sensors that are res=
ponding. Please confirm.

In sec 4.3.2:
=E2=80=9CIn order to improve the accuracy, it is necessary to consider an a=
uthentication method using time series pressure data from the start of wear=
ing the helmet to the complete of wearing.=E2=80=9D
However the authors also said following in sec 2.1;
=E2=80=9CWe think that the helmet-wearing motion is not highly reproducible=
. =E2=80=A6 However, the helmet is worn with one hand, two hands, or in a d=
ifferent direction, and there are a variety of actions from picking up the =
helmet to putting it on. Therefore, it is not practical to collect data fro=
m all individuals for various situations.=E2=80=9D=20

The authors argue that "using time series pressure data from the start of w=
earing"  will improve accuracy. On the other hand, it has been argued that =
"the helmet-wearing motion is not highly reproducible". It seems that the c=
laims are inconsistent.
Which is the author's claim? Why is the claim blurred? It is difficult to a=
ccept a treatise as it is. Please make those claims consistent.

In sec 5.2:
=E2=80=9CIf the best helmet is used for each subject, the system will be ab=
le to obtain accurate data on the head shape of the registrant, and the sys=
tem will not be able to obtain accurate data on the head shape of the non-r=
egistrant whose helmet size does not fit.=E2=80=9D

This sentence is too complicated to understand the meaning. Also, the latte=
r half seems to mention the head shape of non-registrant, but is it mistake=
n for registant?

In sec 5.3:
The proposed method is a claim that only about 5 out of 32 sensors make 100=
% identification. Therefore even more subjects should be able to identify w=
ith rest of sensors effectively. The reviewer thinks there are possibilitie=
s; 1) many sensors not fully utilized, 2) the number of subjects was too sm=
all. The claim that increasing the number of sensors to 50, the same as in =
previous studies, should be able to identify people of the same scale is su=
perficial and questionable. In what area of the head was the sensor that he=
lped improve accuracy in this series of experiments?  The Reviewer think th=
at it is effective to improve the accuracy by investigating which arrangeme=
nt of the sensors works evenly.

In sec 5.5:
=E2=80=9Ci.e. tight=E2=80=9D
It is difficult to guess the word meaning in the senctence.

Necessary corrections throughout the treatise:
Please check the format rules of the treatise.
https://www.ipsj.or.jp/journal/submit/ronbun_j_prms.html
-Abstract seems to be within 200 words, but currently 298 words seems to be=
 too much.
-Please arrange the notation of Section title.

There are many unreadable descriptions and typographical errors in English.=
 Please correct it, such as sending it to English proofreading.
